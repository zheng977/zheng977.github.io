## Motivation

[TODO: Insert Motivation content here. Explain why studying multi-agent financial fraud is critical, the gap in current research regarding collaborative fraud, and the potential risks posed by autonomous agent societies.]

## Abstract

We present **MultiAgent4Fraud**, a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing financial fraud risks posed by collaborative Large Language Model (LLM) agents on social platforms. Our project builds upon OASIS to simulate multi-agent financial-fraud scenarios at scale, capturing the complete lifecycle from public hype building to private persuasion and money transfer. We introduce a heterogeneous agent society mixing benign and malicious agents, and provide extensive benchmarks across 28 real-world fraud scenarios. Experiments show that collaborative agents significantly amplify fraud risks, but are also adaptable to interventions like warning labels. We further explore mitigation strategies, including agent-based auditing and fostering group resilience.

## Framework Overview

Our framework simulates a realistic social media environment where agents interact through public feeds and private direct messages (DMs).

    **Framework Overview.** The system simulates the complete fraud lifecycle: (1) **Public Hype**: Agents post content and interact on the public feed, influenced by a recommendation system. (2) **Private Persuasion**: Malicious agents initiate private conversations with potential victims. (3) **Financial Transfer**: Successful persuasion leads to simulated monetary transfers.

## MultiAgentFraudBench Dataset

We introduce **MultiAgentFraudBench**, a large-scale benchmark covering **28 typical online fraud scenarios** across **7 major categories**: consumer investment, consumer product and service, employment, prize and grant, phantom debt collection, charity, and relationship & trust.

The dataset is constructed via a three-step pipeline: (1) preparing meta-information for specific fraud scenarios, (2) generating target user profiles to improve reach, and (3) synthesizing posts using **DeepSeek-V3**. This process results in a total of 11.9k posts, with a balanced subset of 2.8k posts (100 per subcategory) to ensure diversity.
